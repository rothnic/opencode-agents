# Override Configuration

This file allows humans to temporarily bypass quality gates for special circumstances.
**Agents CANNOT create overrides** - only humans can approve exceptions.

## Format

```yaml
overrides:
  - id: unique-identifier
    created: 2025-10-19T14:30:00Z
    creator: human:username
    reason: "Clear explanation for why override is needed"
    skipChecks:
      - check-name-1
      - check-name-2
    branch: feature/branch-name  # or "*" for all branches
    expiresAt: 2025-10-19T18:00:00Z  # or null for no expiration
    followUpIssue: "#123"  # GitHub issue to track followup work
```

## Available Checks to Skip

- `test-coverage` - Skip test coverage requirements
- `work-verification` - Skip WORK-VERIFICATION.md requirement
- `docs-conventions` - Skip documentation naming conventions
- `file-size` - Skip file size limits
- `document-overlap` - Skip duplicate document detection

## Example: Hotfix Override

```yaml
overrides:
  - id: hotfix-2025-10-19-auth-bypass
    created: 2025-10-19T14:30:00Z
    creator: human:nroth
    reason: "Critical auth vulnerability, needs immediate deploy"
    skipChecks:
      - test-coverage
      - work-verification
    branch: fix/auth-bypass-urgent
    expiresAt: 2025-10-19T18:00:00Z  # Auto-expires after 4 hours
    followUpIssue: "#456"  # Must create tests after merge
```

## Example: Experimental Work

```yaml
overrides:
  - id: experiment-new-test-framework
    created: 2025-10-15T10:00:00Z
    creator: human:nroth
    reason: "Exploring new testing approach, existing conventions don't apply"
    skipChecks:
      - docs-conventions
      - test-coverage
    branch: experiment/new-testing
    expiresAt: null  # No expiration for experimental branches
    followUpIssue: null  # No followup needed for experiments
```

## Agent Instructions

**If you are an agent and need to bypass a quality gate**:

1. **STOP** - Do not proceed
2. **EXPLAIN** the conflict to the user clearly
3. **ASK** the user if they want to create an override
4. **WAIT** for the user to add an override to this file
5. **ONLY THEN** proceed with the work

**You CANNOT create overrides yourself** - this file can only be modified by humans.

## Creating an Override

### Manual Method
Edit this file and add an override entry following the format above.

### CLI Helper (Future)
```bash
node scripts/create-override.js \
  --reason "Critical bug needs immediate fix" \
  --skip test-coverage,work-verification \
  --expires 4h \
  --issue "#123"
```
