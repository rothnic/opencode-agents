# Quality Gates - Identified Gaps and Next Steps

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress

## Current State Assessment

We've successfully implemented a 4-layer defense-in-depth quality gate system:

✅ **Layer 1:** Documentation (quality-gates.md, test-decision-tree.md, checklists)  
✅ **Layer 2:** Validation Scripts (file-location-check.js, test-evidence.js, gate-check.js)  
✅ **Layer 3:** Pre-commit Hooks (automatically runs gate-check.js)  
✅ **Layer 4:** Tests for the Infrastructure (46 passing tests)

## Critical Gaps Discovered

### 1. **SESSION-SUMMARY.md Still in Root** ❌

**Problem:** Our own quality gates detected a violation but we haven't fixed it.  
**Root Cause:** The file-location-check.js correctly identifies SESSION-SUMMARY.md as a session file that should be in `docs/phases/phase-0.2/`  
**Impact:** We're not following our own rules - this is a test of our system!  
**Fix Required:** Move SESSION-SUMMARY.md to docs/phases/phase-0.2/SESSION-SUMMARY.md

### 2. **Blog Post Maintenance Not Automated** ⚠️

**Problem:** We have 16 blog posts, but no agent to:

- Detect when phases complete
- Update stub posts with actual data
- Identify stale or outdated content
- Track which posts need attention

**Current Manual Process:**

- Phase completes → manually remember to update blog
- Metrics change → manually check if blog needs update
- New learnings → manually decide which post to update

**What's Missing:**

- Agent specification for blog maintenance
- Triggers for blog updates (phase completion, milestone reached)
- Freshness checks (last updated > N days ago)
- Content validation (stub vs. complete)

### 3. **No Agent Definitions** ⚠️

**Problem:** This project is called "opencode-agents" but we have no agent specifications yet!

**What We Need:**

- Agent definition format/schema
- List of agents needed for the project
- Agent responsibilities and triggers
- Integration between agents and quality gates

**Proposed Agents:**

1. **Blog Maintenance Agent**
   - Trigger: Phase completion detected
   - Action: Update corresponding blog post with real data
   - Validation: Check post has actual content vs. stub markers

2. **Project Health Agent**
   - Trigger: Daily / on-commit
   - Action: Check for violations, stale docs, missing tests
   - Validation: All checks pass, report generated

3. **Test Coverage Agent**
   - Trigger: Code changes
   - Action: Ensure tests exist for modified code
   - Validation: Coverage thresholds met

4. **Documentation Sync Agent**
   - Trigger: Code structure changes
   - Action: Update architecture diagrams, API docs
   - Validation: Docs reflect current code

### 4. **Test Failure Messages Not Helpful** ❌ → ✅ (Fixed)

**Problem:** When tests fail, error messages were cryptic  
**Example:** `expect(received).toMatch(expected)` with no context  
**Fix Applied:** Updated tests to provide detailed context on failure:

```javascript
if (!output.match(/FAILED/i)) {
  throw new Error(
    `Gate check output should contain failure indicator.\n` +
    `Expected pattern: /FAILED/i\n` +
    `Actual output: ${output.substring(0, 500)}\n` +
    `Exit code: ${exitCode}`
  );
}
```

### 5. **No Freshness Checks** ⚠️

**Problem:** No way to detect when artifacts become stale

**Examples of Staleness:**

- Blog posts not updated in > 30 days
- Documentation referencing deleted code
- Test evidence > 10 minutes old (we have this!)
- Diagrams not updated when architecture changes

**What's Missing:**

- Timestamp tracking for all artifacts
- Freshness thresholds per artifact type
- Automated staleness reports
- Integration with gate checks

### 6. **No Metrics Dashboard** ⚠️

**Problem:** We collect metrics but don't visualize or track trends

**What We Have:**

- Test results with pass/fail counts
- Evidence timestamps
- Gate check results

**What's Missing:**

- Trend analysis (are we improving?)
- Metric history (how have tests changed over time?)
- Dashboards or reports
- Alerts when metrics degrade

## Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: Fix Our Own Violations

- [ ] Move SESSION-SUMMARY.md to docs/phases/phase-0.2/
- [ ] Run gate-check.js and verify it passes
- [ ] Commit with clean state

### Priority 2: Define Agent System

- [ ] Create `docs/agents/README.md` with agent architecture
- [ ] Define agent specification format
- [ ] List all proposed agents with responsibilities
- [ ] Create first agent: Blog Maintenance Agent

### Priority 3: Blog Maintenance

- [ ] Add metadata to blog posts (status: stub|draft|published, last_updated)
- [ ] Create script to detect stub posts
- [ ] Create template for converting stubs to real posts
- [ ] Add gate check: "No stub posts for completed phases"

### Priority 4: Complete Test Suite

- [ ] Fix failing gate-check test (error.status undefined issue)
- [ ] Add tests for edge cases
- [ ] Verify all 46 tests pass consistently

## Future Enhancements

### Phase Completion Automation

- Detect phase completion from commit messages
- Automatically run phase-specific tests
- Generate phase completion report
- Update blog post for that phase
- Archive phase artifacts to correct location

### Continuous Monitoring

- Daily health checks
- Staleness reports
- Metric trending
- Automated issue creation for violations

### Agent Orchestration

- Define agent execution order
- Handle agent dependencies
- Aggregate agent reports
- Escalate critical findings

## Success Criteria

We'll know we've closed these gaps when:

1. ✅ All files are in correct locations (no violations)
2. ✅ All infrastructure tests pass (46/46)
3. ⏳ Blog posts are automatically maintained
4. ⏳ At least 3 agents are defined and operational
5. ⏳ Freshness checks are integrated into gates
6. ⏳ Metrics dashboard shows project health

## Meta-Learning

**Key Insight:** We built quality gates to catch violations, and they immediately caught our own violation (SESSION-SUMMARY.md in root). This validates the defense-in-depth approach!

**Lesson:** Building quality infrastructure reveals gaps in our own processes. We need:

- Agents to automate what we're currently doing manually
- Better integration between quality gates and project artifacts
- Closed feedback loops (detect → alert → fix → verify)

**Next Review:** After SESSION-SUMMARY.md is moved and agent system is defined
