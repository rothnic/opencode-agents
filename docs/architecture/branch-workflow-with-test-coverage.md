# Branch-Based Development with Mandatory Test Coverage

**Status**: Design Complete  
**Created**: 2025-10-19  
**Purpose**: Ensure all feature work includes verifiable tests before merging

---

## Problem Statement

Current issues with direct-to-main commits:

- No guarantee that new features include tests
- Agent might complete work without verification
- No structured reflection on "what was built" vs "how it's verified"
- Tests may exist but not clearly tied to the work
- No organization showing what tests verify what features

---

## Solution: Branch Workflow + Test Coverage Gates

### Workflow

```
1. Start Work
   ‚îú‚îÄ Create feature branch: feature/[work-item]
   ‚îú‚îÄ Record work objectives in branch metadata
   ‚îî‚îÄ Commit work + tests to branch

2. Before Merge
   ‚îú‚îÄ Run test coverage validator
   ‚îú‚îÄ Verify tests exist for work completed
   ‚îú‚îÄ Require work verification document
   ‚îî‚îÄ Check test organization

3. Merge
   ‚îú‚îÄ All checks pass ‚Üí merge to main
   ‚îî‚îÄ Any check fails ‚Üí blocked until fixed
```

---

## Branch Naming Convention

```
feature/[descriptive-name]     # New features
fix/[bug-description]          # Bug fixes
refactor/[component]           # Code refactoring
docs/[topic]                   # Documentation only
test/[coverage-improvement]    # Test additions
chore/[maintenance-task]       # Maintenance work
```

**Examples:**

- `feature/documentation-conventions`
- `feature/phase-1.1-agent-baseline`
- `fix/blog-validation-edge-case`
- `refactor/test-harness-metrics`

---

## Work Verification Document

Each branch must include a `WORK-VERIFICATION.md` in the branch root:

```markdown
# Work Verification: [Feature Name]

**Branch**: feature/[name]  
**Started**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Completed**: YYYY-MM-DD

---

## Objectives

What was this work supposed to accomplish?

- [ ] Objective 1
- [ ] Objective 2
- [ ] Objective 3

---

## Deliverables

What files/features were created or modified?

### Created
- `path/to/new-file.js` - Purpose

### Modified
- `path/to/existing-file.js` - Changes made

---

## Verification Strategy

How do we know this work is correct?

### Test Coverage

| Objective | Test File | Test Description | Status |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Objective 1 | tests/feature/test-name.test.js | Verifies X behavior | ‚úÖ Pass |
| Objective 2 | tests/feature/test-name.test.js | Verifies Y behavior | ‚úÖ Pass |

### Manual Verification

Steps to manually verify (if applicable):
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Expected result

---

## Test Organization

Tests are organized as follows:

```

tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-documentation-conventions.test.js
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Suite: Documentation Conventions Validator
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validates file naming (5 tests)
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validates file locations (3 tests)
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ suggests fixes (4 tests)
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Total: 12 tests

```

---

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] All objectives completed
- [ ] Tests written for all objectives
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Test evidence recorded
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] WORK-VERIFICATION.md complete
- [ ] Ready to merge
```

---

## Pre-Merge Validation Script

`scripts/pre-merge-check.js`:

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
/**
 * Pre-Merge Validation
 * 
 * Ensures branch includes proper test coverage before merging.
 * 
 * Checks:
 * 1. WORK-VERIFICATION.md exists
 * 2. Test files referenced in verification doc exist
 * 3. Tests mentioned are actually passing
 * 4. Work objectives map to tests
 * 5. Test organization is documented
 */

// Validation logic
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Before creating PR/merge
node scripts/pre-merge-check.js

# Output:
‚úÖ WORK-VERIFICATION.md found
‚úÖ 3 objectives defined
‚úÖ 3 test files referenced
‚úÖ All 12 tests passing
‚úÖ Test organization documented
üéâ Ready to merge!
```

---

## Agent Prompts for Test Creation

### Prompt 1: Work Reflection

```
Before committing your work, step back and reflect:

1. What were you asked to build?
2. What did you actually build?
3. How can someone verify it works correctly?
4. What edge cases might break it?

Create WORK-VERIFICATION.md documenting your answers.
```

### Prompt 2: Test Strategy

```
For each objective you completed:

1. Identify the expected behavior
2. List ways that behavior could fail
3. Write tests covering:
   - Happy path (expected use)
   - Edge cases (boundaries, empty inputs)
   - Error cases (invalid inputs, failures)

Organize tests by feature/objective, not by file.
```

### Prompt 3: Test Organization

```
Your test file should be organized like:

describe('Feature: [Feature Name]', () => {
  describe('Objective 1: [What it does]', () => {
    test('handles normal case', ...);
    test('handles edge case X', ...);
    test('handles error case Y', ...);
  });
  
  describe('Objective 2: [What it does]', () => {
    test('...', ...);
  });
});

This makes it clear what each test verifies.
```

---

## Git Hooks Integration

### `.git/hooks/pre-push`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Pre-push hook - validates test coverage before pushing

CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Skip checks for main branch
if [ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" = "main" ]; then
  exit 0
fi

# Run pre-merge validation
node scripts/pre-merge-check.js

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "‚ùå Pre-merge validation failed"
  echo "Fix issues before pushing or merging"
  exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

### `.github/workflows/pr-validation.yml` (if using GitHub)

```yaml
name: PR Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Validate work verification
        run: node scripts/pre-merge-check.js
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        
      - name: Check test coverage
        run: npm run test:coverage
```

---

## Test Organization Standards

### Directory Structure

```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature/                    # Feature-specific tests
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-conventions.test.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-blog-agent.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/                # Integration tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-quality-gates.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/                       # Unit tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-validators.test.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ regression/                 # Regression tests
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-known-bugs.test.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phase-[X]/                  # Phase-specific tests
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-[phase-work].test.js
```

### Naming Conventions

**Test Files:**

- `test-[feature-name].test.js` - Feature tests
- `test-[component-name].spec.js` - Component specs
- `test-[issue-number].test.js` - Bug regression tests

**Test Suites:**

```javascript
describe('Feature: Documentation Conventions', () => {
  describe('File Naming Validation', () => {
    test('accepts lowercase-with-dashes', ...);
    test('rejects camelCase', ...);
    test('rejects PascalCase', ...);
  });
  
  describe('File Location Validation', () => {
    test('allows special docs in root', ...);
    test('blocks content docs in root', ...);
  });
});
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear hierarchy (Feature ‚Üí Capability ‚Üí Test)
- Easy to find tests for a feature
- Test output shows what broke at which level

---

## Enforcement Levels

### Level 1: Warning (Soft Block)

```
‚ö†Ô∏è WORK-VERIFICATION.md missing
   Tests may exist but aren't documented
   Run: node scripts/init-work-verification.js
```

**Action**: Warn but allow merge

### Level 2: Error (Hard Block)

```
‚ùå No tests found for branch work
   Work objectives: 3
   Test files: 0
   
   All feature work must include tests.
   See: docs/architecture/branch-workflow.md
```

**Action**: Block merge until fixed

### Level 3: Coverage Threshold

```
‚ùå Test coverage below threshold
   Current: 65%
   Required: 80%
   
   Add tests to increase coverage.
```

**Action**: Block merge until threshold met

---

## Configuration

### `opencode.json`

```json
{
  "git": {
    "workflow": {
      "requireBranches": true,
      "protectedBranches": ["main"],
      "branchPrefixes": ["feature/", "fix/", "refactor/", "docs/", "test/", "chore/"]
    },
    "preMerge": {
      "requireWorkVerification": true,
      "requireTests": true,
      "minCoverageIncrease": 0,
      "allowedWithoutTests": ["docs/", "chore/"]
    },
    "testOrganization": {
      "structure": "hierarchical",
      "namingConvention": "test-[feature].test.js",
      "requireDescriptiveSuites": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Feature Branch

```bash
# 1. Create branch
git checkout -b feature/documentation-conventions

# 2. Initialize work verification
node scripts/init-work-verification.js

# 3. Do the work
# ... create files, write code ...

# 4. Write tests
# ... create test files ...

# 5. Update work verification
# ... document objectives, tests, verification ...

# 6. Validate before merge
node scripts/pre-merge-check.js

# 7. Commit and push
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: documentation conventions system"
git push origin feature/documentation-conventions

# 8. Create PR (if using GitHub)
# 9. Merge after validation passes
```

### Example 2: Test-Only Branch

```bash
# 1. Create branch for adding missing tests
git checkout -b test/add-validator-coverage

# 2. Write tests for existing code
# ...

# 3. Verify tests pass
npm test

# 4. Update WORK-VERIFICATION.md
# Document what coverage was added

# 5. Merge
git checkout main
git merge test/add-validator-coverage
```

‚úÖ **Clear verification** - Work verification doc shows what and how  
‚úÖ **Test organization** - Easy to find tests for any feature  
‚úÖ **Regression protection** - Tests are tied to work items  

### For Agents

‚úÖ **Structured thinking** - Forced reflection on objectives vs verification  
‚úÖ **Clear requirements** - Know exactly what's needed before merge  
‚úÖ **Self-documenting** - Tests document expected behavior  
‚úÖ **Quality feedback** - Can't skip testing step  

### For Developers

‚úÖ **Protected main** - Main branch is always stable  
‚úÖ **Easy review** - Work verification shows what changed and why  
‚úÖ **Confidence** - Know work is tested before merging

## Edge Cases & Solutions

### Edge Case 1: Documentation-Only Changes

**Solution**: Branch prefix `docs/` can skip test requirements

### Edge Case 2: Chore/Maintenance Work

**Solution**: Branch prefix `chore/` has relaxed test requirements

### Edge Case 3: Urgent Hotfixes

**Solution**: `fix/` prefix requires regression test for the bug

### Edge Case 4: Refactoring

**Solution**: Existing tests must still pass, coverage can't decrease

---

## Validation Errors & Fixes

### Error: "WORK-VERIFICATION.md not found"

```bash
# Fix: Initialize verification document
node scripts/init-work-verification.js
```

### Error: "No tests referenced in verification"

```bash
# Fix: Add test files and update verification
# 1. Write tests
# 2. Update WORK-VERIFICATION.md with test references
```

### Error: "Test file referenced but doesn't exist"

```bash
# Fix: Create the test file or fix the reference
```

### Error: "Objectives don't map to tests"

```bash
# Fix: Add tests for uncovered objectives or remove objectives
```

## Success Metrics

- **Test Coverage**: % of code covered by tests
- **Feature Verification Rate**: % of features with documented tests
- **Merge Block Rate**: % of merges blocked for missing tests
- **Test Organization Score**: % of tests with descriptive suites

**Target**:

- 90%+ features have documented verification
- <5% merge blocks (high compliance)
- 100% tests organized by feature

---

**Result**: Foolproof system ensuring agents always include tests with clear verification before merging work.
