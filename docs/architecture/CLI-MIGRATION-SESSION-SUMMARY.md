   - Created `scripts/commands/utils/`

1. **TypeScript Error Fixes** (Partial)
   - Fixed gate-check.ts index signature errors (2 errors → 0)

### 📊 Progress Metrics

- **Schema Files**: 10/10 (100%)
- **Command Migrations**: 0/15 (0%)
- **TypeScript Errors Fixed**: 2/84 (2.4%)

## Current Status

### Remaining TypeScript Errors: 82

**Priority High (Blocking)**:

- `scripts/testing/test-evidence.ts` - 10 errors (any types, missing types)
- `scripts/gates/file-location-check.ts` - 6 errors (any types, complexity 21)
- `scripts/gates/pre-merge-check.ts` - 23 errors (any types, complexity 28)
- `scripts/gates/init-work-verification.ts` - 5 errors (any types)
- `scripts/gates/gate-check-file-size.ts` - 1 error (index signature)

**Priority Medium**:

- `scripts/agents/blog-maintenance-agent.ts` - 1 error (complexity 16)
- `scripts/validation/check-document-overlap.ts` - 2 errors (non-null assertions)
- `scripts/run-agent.js` - 1 error (complexity 17)

## Next Steps (Recommended Approach)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins - Fix TypeScript Errors (2-3 hours)

1. Fix simple index signature errors (gate-check-file-size.ts)
2. Add types to test-evidence.ts
3. Add types to init-work-verification.ts
4. Reduce complexity in pre-merge-check.ts by extracting functions
5. Reduce complexity in file-location-check.ts by extracting functions
6. Fix non-null assertions in check-document-overlap.ts
7. Run `npm run type-check` to verify

### Phase 2: Command Migration Pattern (1-2 hours)

1. Create ONE working example (e.g., file-size-check)
2. Test the migrated command end-to-end
3. Update npm scripts to use new command
4. Document the pattern

### Phase 3: Bulk Migration (4-6 hours)

1. Migrate remaining gate commands
2. Migrate validation commands
3. Migrate utility commands
4. Update CLI.ts to use all commands
5. Test all commands

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (2-3 hours)

1. Update package.json scripts
2. Update git hooks to use new commands
3. Run full CI pipeline
4. Fix any integration issues

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

- ✅ Schema-first approach clarified command structure
- ✅ Separation of schemas and commands is clean
- ✅ Documentation before coding helped plan better

### What Didn't Work

- ❌ Trying to migrate commands without fixing TypeScript errors first
- ❌ Not testing individual file imports before full migration
- ❌ Underestimating import/export complexity in TypeScript

### Recommended Changes

1. **Fix TypeScript Errors First**
   - Clean compile is prerequisite for migration
   - Much easier to migrate when types are already correct

1. **Start with Simplest Command**
   - file-size-check is simpler than file-location
   - Use as template for others

1. **Test Incrementally**
   - Test each command after migration
   - Don't migrate all at once

1. **Keep Old Files Temporarily**
   - Keep original scripts until new commands are tested
   - Easier rollback if issues found

## Immediate Actions

### Option A: Complete TypeScript Fixes (Recommended)

**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Impact**: Unblocks all future work
**Steps**:

1. Fix all 82 TypeScript errors systematically
2. Get clean `npm run type-check`
3. Commit working state
4. Then proceed with migrations

### Option B: One Working Example

**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Impact**: Proves pattern works
**Steps**:

1. Migrate file-size-check command completely
2. Test it end-to-end
3. Update one npm script
4. Document lessons learned
5. Use as template for remaining commands

### Option C: Parallel Approach

**Time**: 3-4 hours
**Impact**: Moderate progress on both fronts
**Steps**:

1. Fix critical TypeScript errors (test-evidence, pre-merge-check)
2. Migrate one simple command (file-size-check)
3. Test both
4. Assess and continue based on results

## Time Estimates

| Task | Optimistic | Realistic | Pessimistic |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Fix all TS errors | 2h | 3h | 5h |
| Migrate one command | 0.5h | 1h | 2h |
| Migrate all commands | 3h | 5h | 8h |
| Update CLI & scripts | 1h | 2h | 3h |
| Testing & fixes | 1h | 2h | 4h |
| **TOTAL** | **7.5h** | **13h** | **22h** |

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Fix all TypeScript errors (2-3 hours)
   - This unblocks everything else
   - Easier to migrate with clean types
   - Reduces cognitive load

1. **Short-term**: Migrate 2-3 commands (2-3 hours)
   - Start with simplest (file-size-check, verify-tools, status)
   - Prove the pattern works
   - Build confidence

1. **Medium-term**: Complete migration (4-6 hours)
   - Migrate remaining commands
   - Update CLI structure
   - Test everything

1. **Long-term**: Distribution framework (4-8 hours)
   - Add install.sh
   - npm publishing config
   - Global configuration support

## Notes

- The schema foundation is solid and complete
- TypeScript errors are blocking progress
- Pattern is clear, just needs execution time
- Documentation is excellent and will help future work
