## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Strong Foundation

**Tooling**:

- Modern stack: Vitest, TypeScript, Biome, ZLI, Zod
- Quality gates: Pre-commit hooks, validation scripts
- Clean architecture: ES modules, strict types

**Structure**:

- `.opencode/` directory for agents and tools
- `scripts/` with CLI commands and utilities
- `tests/` with existing test infrastructure
- Good separation of concerns

**Documentation**:

- AGENTS.md - Excellent concise guidelines
- CODE-STANDARDS.md - Comprehensive standards
- 16 blog posts documenting journey
- Architecture diagrams

### ⚠️ Gaps to Address

**Missing Components**:

- ❌ Evalite not yet integrated
- ❌ No working benchmarks for agents
- ❌ Agent executor not extracted
- ❌ CLI init command not implemented
- ❌ Framework not packaged for distribution

**Documentation Issues**:

- Redundancy between multiple planning docs
- No clear "quick start" path (fixing)
- Phase directories with stale notes
- Installation model not reflected in README (fixing)

**Testing**:

- 42/45 tests passing (3 failures)
- Tests use old patterns (not using agent executor)
- No performance benchmarks yet

---

## Strategic Alignment

### Against Original Request

> "Allow this project to be installed, then when installed in a project repo the coding agents get picked up and can contribute, then we can override their default functionality as needed for that particular project."

**Alignment**: ✅ **Fully Addressed**

- **Installation Model**: Defined 3 approaches (global preferred)
- **Agent Discovery**: `.opencode/agents/` with global + project override
- **Configuration Override**: Extend pattern (`"extends": "~/.config/opencode/opencode.json"`)
- **CLI Commands**: Designed `init`, `agent add`, `agent override`

### Evalite Integration

> "Integrating <https://www.evalite.dev/> for evals"

**Status**: ✅ **Designed, Not Implemented**

- Strategy documented in INSTALLATION-FRAMEWORK.md
- Example eval structure created
- Benchmark command designed
- Ready for implementation (2 hours estimated)

### Container-Use

> "Potentially using <https://container-use.com/introduction> to manage changes"

**Status**: ✅ **Evaluated, Deferred**

- Reviewed for isolated execution
- Decision: Optional, Phase 4 feature
- Rationale: Start simple, add if needed
- Integration pattern documented

### Developer Experience

> "Think about dev experience"

**Status**: ✅ **Prioritized Throughout**

**Installation** (designed for <30 seconds):

```bash
npm install -g opencode-agents
opencode-agents init
```

**Daily Usage** (simple commands):

```bash
opencode-agents benchmark  # Run evals
opencode-agents validate   # Check quality
opencode-agents agent add custom-specialist
```

**First Contribution** (<10 minutes target):

1. Read README.md
2. Run `opencode-agents init`
3. See working example
4. Start benchmarking

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks

**Risk**: Evals too slow or flaky  
**Mitigation**: Start with simple, fast evals. Increase complexity gradually.

**Risk**: Agent inconsistency across runs  
**Mitigation**: Pin model versions, use Evalite to catch regressions.

**Risk**: Complex installation deters adoption  
**Mitigation**: Test `init` flow frequently on fresh projects. Keep it simple.

**Risk**: Feature creep before proving core works  
**Mitigation**: Complete Week 1 goals before starting Week 2. Measure everything.

### Medium Priority Risks

**Risk**: Documentation becomes stale again  
**Mitigation**: STATUS.md updates required with significant changes. Link docs together.

**Risk**: Configuration becomes too complex  
**Mitigation**: Provide good defaults, make overrides optional.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (This Week)

1. **Start with Evalite** ⭐ **PRIORITY 1**

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev evalite
   ```

   Create first eval, prove benchmarking works.

2. **Extract Agent Executor** ⭐ **PRIORITY 2**
   Standardize how agents run. Clean interface.

3. **Fix 3 Test Failures**
   Get to 100% passing before adding complexity.

4. **Archive Redundant Docs**

   ```bash
   mkdir docs/archive
   mv docs/SUMMARY.md docs/archive/
   mv docs/GETTING-STARTED.md docs/archive/
   ```

### Near-Term (Next 2 Weeks)

5. **Build CLI Init Command**

## Technical Decisions Validated

### ✅ Good Choices

1. **Evalite over Custom Benchmarking**
   - TypeScript-native
   - Vitest-based (familiar)
   - No API key needed
   - Flexible scorers

2. **ZLI + Zod for CLI**
   - Type-safe commands
   - Zero dependencies
   - Perfect for agents
   - Schema reuse across system

3. **Configuration Inheritance**
   - Global defaults in `~/.config/opencode/`
   - Project overrides in `.opencode/`
   - Clear precedence rules

4. **Modern Toolchain**
   - Vitest (10x faster than Jest)
   - Biome (10-50x faster than ESLint)
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - ES modules only

### ⚠️ Watch For

1. **Container-Use Complexity**
   - Start without it
   - Add only if proven necessary

2. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Keep defaults simple
   - Progressive disclosure of features

3. **Documentation Sprawl**
   - Enforce single responsibility per doc
   - Regular consolidation reviews

## Next Session Handoff

### Where We Are

- ✅ Strategic direction defined
- ✅ Documentation created
- ✅ Implementation plan clear
- ⏳ Ready to start building

### What to Do Next

**Option A: Start Building** (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Install Evalite
npm install --save-dev evalite

# 2. Create first eval
mkdir -p evals
touch evals/hello-world.eval.ts

# 3. Implement eval (use IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md as guide)

# 4. Run it
npx evalite evals/

# 5. Iterate until passing
```

**Option B: Clean Up First**

```bash
# 1. Fix tests
npm test

# 2. Archive docs
mkdir docs/archive
mv docs/SUMMARY.md docs/archive/
mv docs/GETTING-STARTED.md docs/archive/

# 3. Fix lint
npm run lint:md:fix

# 4. Commit progress
git add .
git commit -m "docs: consolidate documentation and define framework strategy"
```

**Option C: Do Both** (Best)

1. Archive redundant docs (5 min)
2. Fix markdown lint (auto) (2 min)
3. Commit documentation changes (3 min)
4. Start Evalite integration (2 hours)

### Questions to Answer While Building

1. What's minimum passing score for hello-world eval?
2. Should evals run in CI on every PR?
3. What metrics matter most? (tokens vs quality vs speed)
4. When to publish to npm? (after Phase 2 or 3?)

**Document in**: `docs/DECISION-LOG.md` (create as needed)

---

## Conclusion

The `opencode-agents` project has a **solid foundation** with modern tooling and clear architecture. The strategic direction is now **well-defined** with comprehensive documentation covering installation, implementation, and documentation consolidation.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed from "exploration project" to **installable framework** with clear path to distribution.

**Next Critical Step**: **Prove the system works** by integrating Evalite and getting first benchmark passing. This validates the entire approach before scaling.

**Timeline**: Realistic path to alpha npm package in 3-4 weeks if following the roadmap.

**Recommendation**: Start with Week 1 implementation immediately. The design work is complete; time to build and measure.
