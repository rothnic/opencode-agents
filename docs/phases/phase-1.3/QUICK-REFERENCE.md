## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **17 legacy tests failing** - Expect `scripts/run-agent.js` (now TypeScript at `src/core/executor.ts`)
2. **Session docs uncommitted** - Need to move to phase folder
3. **Markdown lint warnings** - Non-blocking (mostly blog formatting)

---

## 🎯 Next Phase (2.1)

**Goal**: Expand eval coverage

1. Add API client eval
2. Add file processor eval  
3. Add multi-file eval
4. Document baseline performance
