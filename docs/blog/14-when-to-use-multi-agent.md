# When to Use (and Not Use) Multi-Agent Systems

**Status**: STUB - After project completion  
**Target Publication**: After Phase 4  

---

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Multi-Agent Systems Are Worth It When:

[TODO: Based on measured results]

1. **Task complexity threshold**: > X files to modify
2. **Quality requirements**: Need > Y% test coverage
3. **Consistency needs**: Multiple related changes
4. **Audit requirements**: Need verification trail

### Single Agent Is Fine When:

1. **Simple tasks**: < X files
2. **Quick prototypes**: No test requirements
3. **Well-defined scope**: Single clear objective
4. **Human oversight**: Constant review available

## The Complexity Threshold

[TODO: Define based on measurements]

**Our data**:
- Simple tasks (< 3 files): Single agent = X tokens, Multi-agent = Y tokens
- Medium tasks (3-8 files): Single agent = X tokens, Multi-agent = Y tokens
- Complex tasks (> 8 files): Single agent = X tokens (often fails), Multi-agent = Y tokens

**Break-even point**: [TBD] files

## ROI Calculation

[TODO: After full project data]

### Token Cost
- Single agent: [average]
- Multi-agent overhead: [percentage]

### Quality Gain
- Single agent test coverage: [average]
- Multi-agent test coverage: [average]

### Time Cost
- Single agent: [average execution time]
- Multi-agent: [average execution time]

### Is It Worth It?

[TODO: Honest assessment based on data]
