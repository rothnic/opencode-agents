# The Learning Loop: Measuring Improvement

**Status**: STUB - Awaiting Phase 3.2  
**Target Publication**: After Phase 3.2

## Can AI Agents Actually Learn?

Not "learning" in the training sense. But can they:
- Use past experiences?
- Improve over repeated tasks?
- Reduce token usage over time?

---

## The Experiment

[TODO: Phase 3.2 test design]

### Task Repetition
Run same task 3 times:
1. First attempt (baseline)
2. Second attempt (with memory)
3. Third attempt (with refined memory)

### Metrics Collected
- Token count per attempt
- Success rate per attempt
- Time per attempt
- Quality per attempt

---

## Results

[TODO: Fill in from Phase 3.2]

**Hypothesis**: 20-30% token reduction with memory

**Actual**: [TBD]
