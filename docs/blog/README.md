# Blog Posts

This directory contains blog posts documenting the journey of building a test-driven multi-agent development system with OpenCode.

## Series Overview

This blog series chronicles the development of **OpenCode Agents**, a project exploring how to build reliable, measurable, and maintainable multi-agent systems for autonomous software development.

### Key Themes

1. **Test-First Philosophy**: Every capability starts with verification
2. **Measurable Progress**: Real metrics, not subjective claims
3. **Incremental Complexity**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
4. **Systems Thinking**: Defense-in-depth approaches to quality
5. **Practical AI**: Real-world patterns that work today

- Researchers in agent systems
- Practitioners wanting patterns that work

## Publication Status

- **Published**: 0
- **Draft**: 16
- **Planned**: Additional posts as project evolves

## Contributing

As we complete each phase, we'll:
1. Fill in the draft with real data
2. Add screenshots/diagrams
3. Include reproducible examples
4. Publish with lessons learned
