# Permission Systems for AI Agents: Trust but Verify

**Status**: STUB - Awaiting Phase 2.2  
**Target Publication**: After Phase 2.2  

---

## The Problem

AI agents with unlimited permissions can:

- Modify files they should only read
- Execute dangerous commands
- Make changes outside their scope

---

## Permission Levels

[TODO: Define based on agent implementations]

### Read-Only Agents (SecurityAuditor)

- Can: read, grep, search
- Cannot: edit, write, bash

### Limited Execution (TestWriter)

- Can: read, edit, write, npm test
- Cannot: rm, git push, system commands

### Full Access (CodeImplementer)

- Can: Most operations
- Still bounded by project rules

---

## Measured Results

[TODO: Fill in from Phase 2.2 testing]
