## Writing Guidelines Established

### Style

✅ Technical but accessible  
✅ Code examples over theory  
✅ Real metrics over claims  
✅ Honest about failures  

### Structure

✅ Problem statement  
✅ Approach with rationale  
✅ Implementation details  
✅ Measured results  
✅ Lessons learned  

### Tone

✅ Pragmatic, not dogmatic  
✅ Evidence-based  
✅ Acknowledging limitations  
✅ Incrementally building knowledge  

---

## Target Audience

### Primary

- Software engineers exploring AI agents for development
- Engineering managers evaluating AI tooling ROI
- Tech leads deciding between single vs multi-agent

### Secondary

- Researchers in multi-agent systems
- AI tool builders
- Technical writers documenting AI systems

### What They Get

- **Engineers**: Patterns they can implement today
- **Managers**: Data for cost-benefit decisions
- **Researchers**: Measured results on real tasks
- **Builders**: Design patterns that work

---

## Unique Value Propositions

### 1. Measured, Not Claimed

Every assertion backed by real metrics from completed phases

### 2. Incremental Progress

Each phase builds on previous, demonstrating actual improvement

### 3. Honest About Failures

Document what doesn't work, not just successes

### 4. Reproducible

Full implementation available, readers can verify claims

### 5. Practical

Patterns that work today with current tools (OpenCode, GPT-4, etc.)
