# The Orchestrator Pattern: Decomposing Complex Tasks

**Status**: STUB - Awaiting Phase 1.2  
**Target Publication**: After Phase 1.2  
**Estimated Reading Time**: TBD

---

## The Problem

Single AI agents struggle with complex, multi-step tasks. They either:
1. Try to do everything at once (overwhelming)
2. Get distracted mid-task (context drift)
3. Skip steps (incomplete work)

---

## The Orchestrator Pattern

**Core Idea**: One agent decomposes tasks, coordinates specialists

```
User Request → Orchestrator → Specialist Agents → Verified Output
```

### Orchestrator Responsibilities

[TODO: Define based on Phase 1.2 implementation]

- Task decomposition
- TODO list creation
- Progress tracking
- Verification coordination

### Measured Results

[TODO: Fill in with real metrics from Phase 1.2]

**Baseline (single agent)**:
- Token count: [from Phase 1.1]
- Success rate: [from Phase 1.1]

**Orchestrator pattern**:
- Token count: [compare to baseline]
- Success rate: [compare to baseline]
- Task completion: [percentage]

## When to Use

[TODO: Based on experience]
