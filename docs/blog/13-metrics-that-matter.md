# Metrics That Matter for AI Agents

**Status**: STUB - Throughout project  
**Target Publication**: After Phase 3  

---

## Beyond "It Works"

### Vanity Metrics (Don't Use)
- "The agent completed the task" (subjective)
- "Code looks good" (subjective)
- "I think it's working" (subjective)

### Actionable Metrics (Use These)

#### 1. Token Efficiency
```javascript
tokenCount = totalTokensUsed / task
baseline = tokenCountFor(singleAgent, sameTask)
efficiency = (tokenCount / baseline) * 100

// Goal: Multi-agent ≤ 130% of baseline
```

#### 2. Success Rate
```javascript
successRate = (tasksPassed / tasksAttempted) * 100

// Goal: ≥ 95% for production systems
```

#### 3. Test Coverage
```javascript
coverage = (linesCovered / totalLines) * 100

// Goal: ≥ 80%
```

#### 4. Quality Score
```javascript
quality = (testsPass && noCriticalVulns && coverage >= 80) ? 100 : 0

// Boolean: either meets criteria or doesn't
```

## Our Metrics Dashboard

[TODO: Create after multiple phases complete]

### Phase-by-Phase Comparison

| Phase | Token Count | Success Rate | Coverage | Quality |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| 1.1   | [baseline]  | 100%         | N/A      | N/A     |
| 1.2   | [vs baseline] | [TBD]      | N/A      | N/A     |
| 2.1   | [vs baseline] | [TBD]      | [TBD]    | [TBD]   |
