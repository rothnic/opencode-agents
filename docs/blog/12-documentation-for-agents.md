# Documentation That Agents Can Use

**Status**: STUB - Throughout project  
**Target Publication**: Mid-project retrospective  

---

## The Documentation Problem

Human documentation â‰  Agent documentation

### What Doesn't Work

- Prose-heavy explanations
- Implicit knowledge
- Tribal knowledge
- "You know what I mean"

### What Works

- Structured formats
- Explicit patterns
- Code examples
- Clear success criteria

---

## Patterns We've Found

[TODO: Collect examples throughout phases]

### Template Format (Agent Configs)

```markdown
---
description: "Clear one-liner"
mode: subagent
temperature: 0.1
---

You are [role]. Your responsibilities:
1. [Specific task]
2. [Specific task]
3. [Specific task]

You MUST:
- [Requirement]
- [Requirement]

You MUST NOT:
- [Restriction]
- [Restriction]
```
