# Test Evidence: Proving Your AI Agents Actually Work

**Status**: DRAFT - Awaiting Phase 1.1 completion  
**Target Publication**: After Phase 1.1  
**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

---

## The Problem

**Agent**: "I ran the tests. They all pass!"

**You**: "Great! Can you show me the test output?"

**Agent**: "Um... I meant I *would* run them if you asked..."

---

## Why "The Tests Pass" Isn't Enough

[TODO: Fill in after Phase 1.1 baseline testing]

### The Claim vs. Reality Gap

- Claims are easy
- Proof is hard
- Timestamps don't lie

### What Can Go Wrong

1. **Tests never executed**: File exists, never ran
2. **Tests ran yesterday**: Stale results
3. **Different environment**: "Works on my machine"
4. **Selective reporting**: Only showing passing tests

---

## The Test Evidence System

### Core Concept: Timestamped Proof

```json
{
  "phase": "phase-1.1",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T10:23:45.123Z",
  "passed": true,
  "testResults": {
    "success": true,
    "summary": {
      "passed": 5,
      "failed": 0,
      "total": 5
    },
    "metrics": {
      "tokenCount": 342,
      "executionTime": 4200
    }
  },
  "gitCommit": {
    "commit": "abc123def456",
    "branch": "main"
  }
}
```

### Recording Evidence

[TODO: Add real examples from Phase 1.1 execution]

```bash
$ npm test && node scripts/test-evidence.js phase-1.1
# Real output will go here
```

### Verifying Evidence

[TODO: Add verification examples]

```bash
$ node scripts/test-evidence.js --verify phase-1.1
# Real output will go here
```

## Real-World Results

[TODO: Fill in with actual metrics from Phase 1.1]

### Baseline Test (Phase 1.1)

- **Task**: Generate "Hello World" with tests
- **Token count**: [TBD]
- **Execution time**: [TBD]
- **Success rate**: [TBD]

### Evidence Quality

- **Timestamp accuracy**: ✓
- **Reproducibility**: ✓
- **Audit trail**: ✓

---

## Implementation Details

[TODO: Expand based on actual usage patterns]

### The 10-Minute Rule

Why evidence must be < 10 minutes old for phase completion

### Environment Capture

Why we record Node version, platform, git commit

### Metrics Collection

What metrics matter and why

## Lessons Learned

[TODO: Fill in after Phase 1.1 experience]

## Next Steps

- **Next post**: The Orchestrator Pattern (Phase 1.2)
- **Try it**: [Link to implementation]
