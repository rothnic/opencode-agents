# Complex Task Testing: Preventing Agent Drift

**Status**: STUB - Awaiting Phase 4.2.1  
**Target Publication**: After Phase 4.2  

---

## The Drift Problem

**Task**: Refactor payment system for multi-currency support

**What happens**:
- File 1: ✓ Adds currency field
- File 2: ✓ Updates API signature
- File 3: ✗ Forgets about currency, uses old pattern
- File 4: ✗ Starts rewriting unrelated code
- File 5: ✗ Completely off-task

This is **context drift** and it kills complex tasks.

## The Test

[TODO: Design from Phase 4.2.1]

### Multi-File Refactoring Challenge

Requirements:
- Touch 8+ files
- Maintain consistency
- All files reference same pattern
- No scope creep

### Success Criteria

[TODO: Define measurable criteria]

---

## Results

[TODO: Fill in from Phase 4.2.1]

**Single agent**: [expected drift rate]  
**Multi-agent**: [actual drift rate]
